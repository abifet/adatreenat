Mining Adaptively Frequent Closed Unlabeled Rooted Trees in Data Streams.

Albert Bifet and Ricard Gavald√†.

14th ACM SIGKDD Intl. Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'08)

This software is an implementation of three closed unlabeled tree mining algorithms:
 - an incremental one, INCTREENAT
 - a sliding-window based one, WINTREENAT 
 - one that mines closed trees adaptively from data streams, ADATREENAT

The input should be a text file that uses:

- TreeNat's string encoding form :
   * each line represents a transaction
   * the string is a depth-first traversal of the rooted tree
     where "[" represents a new node and "]" means a backtrack
   
   For example, here is a database with 3 rooted trees.

	[[[][][]][[][]]]
	
	[[[][][]][[[]]]]
	
	[[[[[]]]]] 


- Professor Zaki's string encoding form: 
  * each line represents a transaction
  * the first two numbers are identical, they are tids
  * the 3rd number represents the length of the remaining string
  * the rest string is a depth-first traversal of the rooted tree, where "-1" means a backtrack.
  
   For example, here is a database with 3 rooted trees.

	0 0 15 1 1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 1 -1 -1
	
	1 1 15 1 1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1
	
	2 2 9 1 1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1
